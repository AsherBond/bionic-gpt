Enterprises prefer **B2B SaaS solutions** because they offer a cost-effective, scalable, and flexible way to streamline business operations. With SaaS, companies can avoid upfront capital expenditures, reduce IT burdens, and enjoy automatic software updates, freeing up resources for core business activities.

Despite the advantages of SaaS, **not all enterprise software has transitioned to the cloud**. Legacy systems, complex integrations, and **sensitive data concerns** can make migration challenging. Some industries, such as finance and healthcare, have strict regulations and security requirements that may necessitate on-premise solutions.

In this article we'll cover some Defence in Depth best practices along with the emerging availability of Secure Compute to show how even more Enterprise Applications can move to a SaaS model.
