When creating software it's often a good practice to document the architecture using  a technique called [Architecture Decision Records](https://adr.github.io/).

An ADR is nothing more than a markdown document that records the title, status, context, decision, and consequences of a particular design choice.

When a decision is made it's often helpful to create a small Proof of Concept that illustrates how the decision will play out in the real world. 

I found previously when working on the [Rust on Nails](https://rust-on-nails.com/) architecture that when you combine the ADR's with Proofs of Concept the result reads like a tutorial on how to build a system in a particular way.
